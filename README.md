## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation (2 minutes)

```bash
npm install -g @aichatwatch/aicw
aicw
```

**Requirements:**

- API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) (recommended, free tier available) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

**Cost:** The software is free. You only pay for AI usage through OpenRouter/OpenAI/Perplexity as you consume it:
- Typical cost: **$0.01-$0.10 per answer** + **$0.01-$0.05 per question** for enrichment/analysis
- **Example:** 5 questions × 3 AI models = 15 answers + enrichment ≈ **$0.30-$1.75 total** (depending on which models you select)
- You control costs by choosing which models to query (free, mid-tier, or premium) 

### Your First Report (5 minutes)

```bash
# Interactive mode (easiest)
aicw
→ Create new project
→ Select AI models preset + enter your topic and preset of questions to use
→ Get your first AI monitoring report!

## 💰 Cost Transparency

### Software: FREE ✅

AICW software itself is **completely free** with **no limits**. Run it on your computer as much as you want - unlimited projects, unlimited questions, unlimited reports. No subscription fees. No usage caps. No hidden costs.

### AI Usage: Pay-As-You-Go 💳

The **only cost** is for AI API usage through your chosen provider (OpenRouter, OpenAI, or Perplexity). You pay directly to these providers only for what you consume.

**Typical Costs:**
- **$0.01-$0.10 per answer** from an AI model (depends on which model you choose)
- **$0.01-$0.05 per question** for enrichment/analysis step (entity extraction, trend calculation)

**Real Example - 5 Questions × 3 AI Models:**

| Scenario | Cost per Answer | Total Answers | Enrichment | **Total Cost** |
|----------|----------------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Budget** (free/cheap models) | $0.01 | 15 answers = $0.15 | 5 questions × $0.02 = $0.10 | **~$0.25** |
| **Balanced** (mix of models) | $0.05 | 15 answers = $0.75 | 5 questions × $0.03 = $0.15 | **~$0.90** |
| **Premium** (GPT-4, Claude Sonnet) | $0.10 | 15 answers = $1.50 | 5 questions × $0.05 = $0.25 | **~$1.75** |

**You Control Everything:**
- ✅ Choose which AI models to query (free, mid-tier, or premium)
- ✅ Decide how many questions to ask
- ✅ Select how many models per question
- ✅ Monitor costs in real-time (check your OpenRouter/OpenAI dashboard)
- ✅ No surprises - you see exactly what you'll pay before running

See `src/config/models/ai_models.json` for AI models and `src/config/models/ai_presets/` for AI models presets.
