# AI Chat Watch (AICW)

AI Chat Watch (aka AICW) is the tool for GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) marketers to track mentions of brands/products/websites by AI like ChatGPT. See who is mentioned first and how often, by which AI, how mentions change over time. Instantly see sources for citations. Track trends over time. See how your brand is positioned compared to competitors in AI search results. AICW is **free open-source and runs on your computer, you own all your data**. Explore sample reports: https://aichatwatch.com/demo/reports/

*ELI5 (Explain like I'm 5 years old)?*: *AI Chat Watch is like a notebook that keeps track of which toys or pizza places the robot talks about!*

## 🚀 Quick Start

# Try it without installation

Run `Terminal` app and paste this command:

```bash
npx @aichatwatch/aicw
```

### Installation (2 minutes)

Run `Terminal` app and paste this command:

```bash
npm install -g @aichatwatch/aicw
```

Then run by typing:

```bash
aicw
``` 

And press Enter to start AICW (AI Chat Watch) and follow the instructions.

**Requirements:**

- Node.js 18+ ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) (recommended, free tier available) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or any other AI model provider.

**Cost:** The software is free. You only pay for AI usage through OpenRouter/OpenAI/Perplexity as you consume it:
- Typical cost: **$0.01-$0.10 per answer** + **$0.01-$0.05 per question** for enrichment/analysis
- **Example:** 5 questions × 3 AI models = 15 answers + enrichment ≈ **$0.30-$1.75 total** (depending on which models you select)
- You control costs by choosing which models to query (free, mid-tier, or premium) and how many questions to ask.

## 📊 Pipeline Architecture

_Last updated: 2025-10-14_

AICW uses a multi-stage pipeline to transform AI responses into actionable insights. Here's the complete build pipeline flow:

### Pipeline Types

1. **pipeline-project-new**: Create a new project with questions → Auto-runs pipeline-project-build
2. **pipeline-project-build**: Complete pipeline - Fetch fresh AI answers, extract entities, enrich data, generate reports
3. **pipeline-project-rebuild**: Rebuild from existing answers - Skip fetch step, reprocess everything else
4. **pipeline-project-rebuild-report-only**: Generate reports only - Use existing enriched data, regenerate HTML

### Key Stages

- **Setup Phase** (cyan): Prepares project structure and cleans old data
- **Data Collection** (green): Queries AI models for answers (skipped in rebuild)
- **Entity Extraction** (yellow): Identifies companies, products, people, places, events
- **Link Processing** (orange): Classifies URLs and domains by type
- **Enrichment** (purple): Calculates metrics, trends, and generates AI insights
- **Report Generation** (blue): Creates interactive HTML reports with visualizations
