# AI Chat Watch (AICW)

Track who and what is mentioned by ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity and other AIs.
See who is mentioned first and how often. See which websites are mentioned and cited by AIs. Track trends over time. See influence scores. See how your brand is positioned compared to competitors. AICW is **free open-source and runs on your computer**. Explore sample reports: https://aichatwatch.com/demo/reports/

*ELI5 (Explain like I'm 5 years old)?*: *AI Chat Watch is a free app that runs on your computer and asks AIs like ChatGPT to answer a set of questions. Then it reads these answers and telling: which companies, people, places, events are mentioned, in which order and how often. If you run it again after some time, it will also tell how answers changed. Best of all, it's open-source and runs on your computer.*

## 🚀 Quick Start

# Try it without installation

Run `Terminal` app and paste this command:

```bash
npx @aichatwatch/aicw
```

### Installation (2 minutes)

Run `Terminal` app and paste this command:

```bash
npm install -g @aichatwatch/aicw
```

Then run by typing:

```bash
aicw
``` 

And press Enter to start AICW (AI Chat Watch) and follow the instructions.

**Requirements:**

- Node.js 18+ ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) (recommended, free tier available) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or any other AI model provider.

**Cost:** The software is free. You only pay for AI usage through OpenRouter/OpenAI/Perplexity as you consume it:
- Typical cost: **$0.01-$0.10 per answer** + **$0.01-$0.05 per question** for enrichment/analysis
- **Example:** 5 questions × 3 AI models = 15 answers + enrichment ≈ **$0.30-$1.75 total** (depending on which models you select)
- You control costs by choosing which models to query (free, mid-tier, or premium) and how many questions to ask.

## 📊 Pipeline Architecture

_Last updated: 2025-10-14_

AICW uses a multi-stage pipeline to transform AI responses into actionable insights. Here's the complete build pipeline flow:

### Pipeline Types

1. **pipeline-project-new**: Create a new project with questions → Auto-runs pipeline-project-build
2. **pipeline-project-build**: Complete pipeline - Fetch fresh AI answers, extract entities, enrich data, generate reports
3. **pipeline-project-rebuild**: Rebuild from existing answers - Skip fetch step, reprocess everything else
4. **pipeline-project-rebuild-report-only**: Generate reports only - Use existing enriched data, regenerate HTML

### Key Stages

- **Setup Phase** (cyan): Prepares project structure and cleans old data
- **Data Collection** (green): Queries AI models for answers (skipped in rebuild)
- **Entity Extraction** (yellow): Identifies companies, products, people, places, events
- **Link Processing** (orange): Classifies URLs and domains by type
- **Enrichment** (purple): Calculates metrics, trends, and generates AI insights
- **Report Generation** (blue): Creates interactive HTML reports with visualizations
