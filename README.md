*ELI5 (Explain like I'm 5 years old)?*: *AI Chat Watch is a free app that runs on your computer and asks AIs like ChatGPT to answer a set of questions. Then it reads these answers and telling: which companies, people, places, events are mentioned, in which order and how often. If you run it again after some time, it will also tell how answers changed. Best of all, it's open-source and runs on your computer.*

**Cost:** The software is free. You only pay for AI usage through OpenRouter/OpenAI/Perplexity as you consume it:
- Typical cost: **$0.01-$0.10 per answer** + **$0.01-$0.05 per question** for enrichment/analysis
- **Example:** 5 questions × 3 AI models = 15 answers + enrichment ≈ **$0.30-$1.75 total** (depending on which models you select)
