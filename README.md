# AI Chat Watch (AICW) – Monitor AI Engines & Maximize Your AI Visibility

`AICW` is a comprehensive monitoring and optimization suite designed to help you dominate the emerging AI search landscape. Track how AI engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and others discover, cite, and recommend your brand—while giving you actionable intelligence to improve your AI visibility.

What You Get:

1) **AI Search Results Tracking**:

- Track brand, product, and competitor mentions across major AI search engines
- Track how often mentioned, position in search results, share of voice
- Review sources for citations for specific items
- Review sources for type of content, domains, and website types
- Analyze trends over time

2) **AI Visibility Auditing**:

- Assess how "AI-readable" your website and content are

## 🚀 Quick Start

# Grade AI visibility of your website

Run `Terminal` app and paste this command:

```bash
npx @aichatwatch/aicw ai-visibility YOURWEBSITE.com
```

Run in interactive mode to create and run detailed AI visibility report 

```bash
npx @aichatwatch/aicw
```

**NOTE** if you are getting errors about access denied or permissions, then you may need to add `sudo` prefix to the command to run it as administrator, for example:

```
sudo npx @aichatwatch/aicw ai-visibility YOURWEBSITE.com
```

### Installation (Recommended for continuous monitoring)

Run `Terminal` app and paste this command:

```bash
npm install -g @aichatwatch/aicw
```

After installation, run `aicw` just by typing `aicw` and hitting Enter. It will start AICW in interactive mode.

```bash
aicw
``` 

**Requirements:**

- Node.js 18+ ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) (recommended, free tier available) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or any other AI model provider.

**Cost:** The software is free. You only pay for AI usage through OpenRouter/OpenAI/Perplexity as you consume it:
- Typical cost: **$0.01-$0.10 per answer** + **$0.01-$0.05 per question** for enrichment/analysis
- **Example:** 5 questions × 3 AI models = 15 answers + enrichment ≈ **$0.30-$1.75 total** (depending on which models you select)
- You control costs by choosing which models to query (free, mid-tier, or premium) and how many questions to ask.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### API Key Setup Issues

If you run `ai-visibility` and get the error:

```
No API keys were set! Please run "Setup: setup API Key" first and then try again.
```

This typically means you're running an outdated version. Update AICW using:

```bash
npm update @aichatwatch/aicw
```

Then try running your command again.

### Permission Errors / Crashes

If AICW crashes or asks for permission when running, you need to run it with administrator privileges:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
sudo npx @aichatwatch/aicw
# or if installed globally
sudo aicw
```

**Windows:**
1. Right-click on `Command Prompt` or `PowerShell`
2. Select "Run as Administrator"
3. Then run your AICW command normally:
```bash
npx @aichatwatch/aicw
```

## 📊 Pipeline Architecture

_Last updated: 2025-10-14_

AICW uses a multi-stage pipeline to transform AI responses into actionable insights. Here's the complete build pipeline flow:

### Pipeline Types

1. **pipeline-project-new**: Create a new project with questions → Auto-runs pipeline-project-build
2. **pipeline-project-build**: Complete pipeline - Fetch fresh AI answers, extract entities, enrich data, generate reports
3. **pipeline-project-rebuild**: Rebuild from existing answers - Skip fetch step, reprocess everything else
4. **pipeline-project-rebuild-report-only**: Generate reports only - Use existing enriched data, regenerate HTML

### Key Stages

- **Setup Phase** (cyan): Prepares project structure and cleans old data
- **Data Collection** (green): Queries AI models for answers (skipped in rebuild)
- **Entity Extraction** (yellow): Identifies companies, products, people, places, events
- **Link Processing** (orange): Classifies URLs and domains by type
- **Enrichment** (purple): Calculates metrics, trends, and generates AI insights
- **Report Generation** (blue): Creates interactive HTML reports with visualizations
