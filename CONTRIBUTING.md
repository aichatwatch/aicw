## Contributor License Agreement

That we do not have any potential problems later it is sadly necessary to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). That can be done literally with the push of a button.

It is the most simple one that exists and it is from [Indie Open Source](https://indieopensource.com/forms/cla) which uses plain English and is literally only a few lines long.

Once a pull request is opened, an automated bot will promptly leave a comment requesting the agreement to be signed. The pull request can only be merged once the signature is obtained.
